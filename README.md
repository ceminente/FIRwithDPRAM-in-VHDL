# FIRwithDPRAM-in-VHDL: project for Management and Analysis for Physics Datasets mod. A
In the present repository you can find the final project assigned as part of the course Management and Analysis for Physics Datasets mod. A at the University of Padua.

## Project
### Authors:

- [Clara Eminente](https://github.com/ceminente) (University of Padova)
- [Alberto Chimenti](https://github.com/albchim) (University of Padova)

### Supervised by:

- Professor Gianmaria Collazuol (University of Padova, INFN)


###  Description and Results
We implemented an five tap FIR filter in VHDL along with a simulated version of a dual port ram (DPRAM).
The implementation was tested in simulation environment only.
A more deteiled description of the project can be found in the report "FIR_filter_with_DPRAM_in_VHDL.pdf"
